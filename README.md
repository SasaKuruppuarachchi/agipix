# Agipix — Bridging Simulation and Reality for Aerial Robotics

![banner](_assets/images/exploded.gif)

Agipix is an open hardware and software platform for agile indoor autonomy that runs the same ROS 2, containerized stack in both Isaac Sim and on the real robot. A small 438×372 mm footprint with a multi-modal sensor suite (3D LiDAR, RGB camera, IMU) and a Jetson Orin NX companion enables robust exploration and mapping with zero code changes from sim to real.

For the accompanying paper-style write-up, see `todo` (IEEE conference format). It details hardware co-design, the LiDAR–inertial–visual stack, the Isaac Sim digital twin, and sim-to-real synchronization.

## Highlights

1) Sim-to-real deployability — Identical ROS 2 containers and configs run in Isaac Sim and on hardware; zero code changes between environments.

2) Open-source hardware and software — Full BOM, CAD, simulation assets, and the containerized ROS 2 stack are released in this repo: [bom/BOM.md](bom/BOM.md), [cad/](cad/), [model_exports/](model_exports/), [doc/](doc/), [LICENSE](LICENSE).

3) ROS 2–based modular autonomy stack — Perception, state estimation, mapping, planning, PX4 interface, and logging run as decoupled nodes/containers with DDS QoS tuning.

4) Small form factor for indoor navigation — Compact 438×372 mm envelope with guards; measured thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) ≈ 2.98:1 for precise maneuvers in tight spaces.

5) Extensive sensor system incl. 3D LiDAR — 3D LiDAR, RGB camera, and IMU integrated into a LiDAR–inertial–visual stack for robust mapping and exploration.

6) Modular hardware with expandability — Layered decks and accessible power/data breakouts simplify sensor or compute upgrades without redesign.
