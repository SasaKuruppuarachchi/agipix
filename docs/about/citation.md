# Citation and Publication

## Academic Paper

A detailed academic paper describing the Agipix platform is in preparation. The paper covers:

- Hardware co-design and system architecture
- LiDAR-inertial-visual sensor fusion stack
- Isaac Sim digital twin implementation
- Sim-to-real synchronization techniques
- Experimental validation and benchmarks

The manuscript is being prepared in IEEE conference format. See `root.tex` in the repository for the LaTeX source.
