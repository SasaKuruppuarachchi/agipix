## Simulation Setup

- Host: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, NVIDIA GPU/driver; optional Dockerized workflow via isaac_ros_common (branch `agipix-sim`).
- Install ROS 2 Humble and NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim; enable the ROS 2 bridge extension.
- (Optional) Nucleus Server for assets; tmux for session management.
- PX4 SITL build and param tweak for DDS sync; ensure ROS 2 nodes use `use_sim_time`.
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit + Docker/Portainer if running inside containers.

## Run the Simulation
- Start Isaac Sim (first launch can take a while) and ensure the ROS 2 bridge is active.
- In the container/session, build and run the control stack; follow the provided tmux panes.
- Connect visualization via Foxglove at ws://localhost:8765 (see details in the setup doc).

## Next steps
- Continue to autonomy stack: 
- UI/teleop and mission flows:
